## Our project:

 In our fitness tracking app users can track how far, how long and how fast
 they were walking/ running/ hiking/ biking/ ...
 The tracks are saved in a room database and visualized in a barchart and in text form.

 In the settings, the user can choose wether he/she wants the app to be displayed in dark or light mode.

### We want to use the following grading categories:

- Location and Sensors
- Data Storage

### Data for demonstration

For demonstration purposes their are already some tracks inserted to the database when the app is started for the first time. If the app is published, those example tracks would be removed beforehand.
