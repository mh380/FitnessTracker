## Our project:

    In our fitness tracking app users can track how far, how long and how fast
    they were walking/ running/ hiking/ biking/ ...
    The tracks are saved in a room database and visualized in a barchart and in a RecyclerView in text form.

    In the settings, the user can choose wether he/she wants the app to be displayed in dark or light mode.

### We want to use the following grading categories:

    Location and Sensors
    Data Storage
