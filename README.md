## Our project:

 In our fitness tracking app users can track how far, how long and how fast
 they were walking/ running/ hiking/ biking/ ...
 The tracks are saved in a room database and visualized in a barchart and in text form.

 In the settings, the user can choose wether he/she wants the app to be displayed in dark or light mode.

### We want to use the following grading categories:

- Location and Sensors
- Data Storage

### Data for demonstration

For demonstration purposes their are already some tracks inserted to the database when the app is started for the first time. If the app is published, those example tracks would be removed beforehand.

### Recording of a route

Before we can click on the Start button in TrackMaster to begin recording a route, we first need to create one. Above the emulator, on the top right, there are three horizontally aligned dots. Clicking on this button opens a window. Now, we select the "Location" tab. In the Single Points tab, we can choose a specific point for our route. Simply enter the desired location in the search bar, click on "SAVE POINT," and assign an appropriate name. Under Saved Routes, click on the three dots next to our saved location and select "Start a route." Now, we can customize the start and end points, choose a mode of transportation, or select none. Once the route and mode of transportation are set, we can save the route under "SAVE ROUTE." I recommend setting the "Playback speed" to "Speed 4X" at the bottom right. After that, click on "PLAY ROUTE" and switch back to the TrackMaster app. Now, click the Start button, and the route recording will begin.
